# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with Google OAuth authentication in Emmy's Learning App. The current implementation has redirect URL mismatches, callback handling problems, and authentication flow inconsistencies that prevent users from successfully signing in with Google.

## Glossary

- **OAuth_System**: The Google OAuth authentication integration within Emmy's Learning App
- **Supabase_Auth**: The Supabase authentication service that handles OAuth providers
- **Auth_Callback**: The component that processes OAuth redirect responses
- **Redirect_URL**: The URL where Google redirects users after authentication
- **User_Context**: The React context that manages user authentication state

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with Google so that I can access my learning progress without creating a separate account

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Continue with Google", THE OAuth_System SHALL redirect to Google's authentication page
2. WHEN Google authentication completes successfully, THE OAuth_System SHALL redirect to the correct callback URL
3. WHEN the callback is processed, THE User_Context SHALL establish a valid user session
4. WHEN authentication fails, THE OAuth_System SHALL display a clear error message to the user
5. WHEN a user completes Google sign-in, THE OAuth_System SHALL create or update their user profile in Supabase

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OAuth callback URLs to be properly configured so that authentication flows work in both development and production environments

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Supabase_Auth SHALL be configured with correct redirect URLs for both development and production
2. THE Auth_Callback SHALL handle OAuth responses from the correct redirect endpoints
3. WHEN deployed to GitHub Pages, THE OAuth_System SHALL use the production redirect URL
4. WHEN running locally, THE OAuth_System SHALL use the development redirect URL
5. THE OAuth_System SHALL validate redirect URL origins to prevent security issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication process to be reliable so that I don't get stuck on loading screens or error pages

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth callback processing takes longer than expected, THE Auth_Callback SHALL provide user feedback
2. WHEN authentication errors occur, THE OAuth_System SHALL redirect users back to the login page with error context
3. WHEN session establishment fails, THE User_Context SHALL handle the error gracefully without infinite loading
4. THE OAuth_System SHALL clear authentication tokens from URLs after processing
5. WHEN users refresh during authentication, THE OAuth_System SHALL handle the state appropriately
